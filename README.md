# Deep-learning
This folder contains the codes for the Deep Learning course at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen.
For assignment 1 we created a binary classifier of MRI images to detect brain tumours based on the VGG16 Convolutional neural network.
pre.py contains the code for the initial preprocessing of the images
Neural_Net_VGG16 contains the code for the VGG16 architecture and the training of the model. Additionally, some extra preprocessing is contained to give the data the right dimensions for the VGG16 network.
